Octavious is a very lightweight mutli processing framework helps you parallelize
your tasks within a plugin pipeline system.

Run the example app:
--------------------

::

    $ python -m unittest -v octavious.tests
    test_pipeline (octavious.tests.TestPipeline) ... ok
    test_call_symbol (octavious.tests.TestUtils) ... ok
    test_load_symbol (octavious.tests.TestUtils) ... ok

    ----------------------------------------------------------------------
    Ran 3 tests in 0.001s

    OK
    $ python -m examples.simple
    * Chuck Norris uses ribbed condoms inside out, so he gets the pleasure.

    * Chuck Norris doesn't read books. He stares them down until he gets the information he wants.

    * MacGyver can build an airplane out of gum and paper clips. Chuck Norris can kill him and take it.


Currently in very early stages, please stay tuned...
